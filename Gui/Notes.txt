In Ubuntu there is a problem related to cmake finding the correct python library

To solve:
 - add the correct version include and lib to .bashrc 
 - rename the version that found by cmake to less version e.g. from 3.7 to 3.0.7
 - link the correct version of python to /usr/bin/python and /usr/bin/python3
